# OPTIMIZING THE GENOMIC-ENZYMATIC MODEL OF Yarrowia lipolytica FOR BIOFUEL PRODUCTION: A CONSTRAINT-BASED RECONSTRUCTION ANALYSIS AND METAHEURISTIC ALGORITHMS-BASED APPROACH

## Abstract

This thesis aims to address the pressing need for sustainable alternatives to conventional methods of industrial production. Industrial biotechnology presents a promising avenue for achieving this goal, particularly through the use of living organisms in novel production processes. However, the high cost of traditional laboratory-based experimentation necessitates the development of computational models to accelerate progress in this field. This research focuses on the modeling of Yarrowia lipolytica as a platform for producing Odd-Chain Fatty Acids (OCFAs) at an industrial scale. Using Flux Balance Analysis (FBA), we will explore the metabolic network of this non-conventional yeast and develop a new optimized phenotype for OCFA production. The goal of this work is to advance our understanding of Y. lipolytica and contribute to the development of sustainable biotechnological processes for the production of high-value compounds.
